# SMS-Spam-Detection-With-Machine-Learning-In-Python

 * This application will be built with Python using the Flask framework and will include a machine learning model that will train to detect SMS spam.
 * Do ‚≠ê the repository , if it helped you in anyway.

# Libraries Used :

* flask is for creating the application server and pages.
